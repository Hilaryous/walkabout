Walkabout utilizes open source data from the denver area detailing historical locations, public works of art, parks and park fountains. A user create a walk with a distance of their choosing, then a walk with directions is generated with eight of the previously mentioned locations on it. 

This app utilized the google directions javascript v3 api and the geocoder gem for both geocoding and reverse geocoding. Other things to look for are high test coverage, single table inheretance, and direct upload to s3 to make uploading images faster. Also worth noting the app was deployed on a vps.
